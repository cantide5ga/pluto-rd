In progress dead simple blogging library with word cloud navigation.

Lib consumers will:
- implement a driver to return Entries and Keywords (call a database, pull from file system, static code, whatever!)
- use well defined selectors to style
- optionally use JSX to structure the view
- optionally use Typescript definitions with Typings
- optionally use a Browserified script instead of npm (see current example in reference/)
- optionally expose a CMS interface to add new blog entries using Markdown

## TODO
cms w/ markdown (react/flux - executes post on action creator)
